  E.g to add source file name to the =Back= field of =Basic= note type:
  #+begin_src elisp
  (customize-set-variable
   'org-anki-field-templates
   '(("Basic"
      ("Back" . (lambda (it)
                  (let ((path (buffer-file-name)))
                    (concat it (format "<p><a href='%s'>%s</a></p>" path path))))))))
  #+end_src

* v2.0.0
- support multiline card front:

  When an org entry has subheadings that exactly match the note

  is taken from the body of the main title.
